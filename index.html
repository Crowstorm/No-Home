		<p>Currently working: 2nd and 3rd level. Rebuilding 1st level to serve as tutorial</p>
		<p>Game is optimised to be played on desktops and laptops. It should work on most mobile devices, however, turning your screen to the side is recommended</p>
  				<p>In order to travel to next locations you will need to click objects like doors or entrances.</p>
			    <p>Sometimes characters will talk to you automatically. Other times it will be up to you to interact with them</p>
			    <p>If you see an interesting item you can try to pick  it up by clicking on it. Who knows, it may come in handy</p>
			    <p>To use an item, click on it, then click on desired object.</p>
			    <p>Sometimes you may be asked to answer some questions or type in passwords to proceed. Type your answers into forms</p>
			    <p>Dont give up when you're frustrated, answer may be simpler than you think. Sometimes you may find additional tips if you try long enough.</p>
			    <p>If you find a minor bug or one stopping you from finishing the game contact me at mateuszmazurofficial@gmail.com or via medium where you found the game</p>
